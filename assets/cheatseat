The suit of cups rules over all that is associated with emotions, the uncons­cious, creati­vity, and intuition. They frequently talk about relati­ons­hips, whether romantic or otherwise, and one's imagin­ation and inner world. They are associated with the element of water, which becomes a frequent visual theme within this suit.
